       "   'summary': 'A new study commissioned by Penumbra Brands finds that radiation emanating from the iPhone 11 Pro is at a level thought to be dangerous to consumers. Specifically, results tabulated by RF Exposure Lab reveal that radiation from the iPhone 11 Pro is more than twice the FCC\\'s existing safety limit. The tests were performed with an iPhone 11 Pro located approximately 5mm away from a mannequin, with RF Exposure Lab noting that the radiation exposure could be even more pronounced if a phone is located in a user\\'s pocket. \"Cellphone users should be concerned about exposure to RF radiation,\" Penumbra Brands CTO Ryan McCaughey said in a press release. \"The testing shows the iPhone 11 Pro potentially exposes people to more than double what the FCC has deemed safe.\" So should you be worried? Well, you might want to take this report with a whopping grain of salt. For starters, look at the chart below. It seems a bit jarring at first glance, to be sure. However, you\\'ll notice that a standalone iPhone 11 Pro is being measured against iPhones housed in Gadget Guard cases with alara technology.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"As the new strain of coronavirus continues to spread across huge chunks of China, the outbreak's impact on the world at large is growing more and more obvious. There's obviously the risk that the virus could spread to even more countries, but even if it remains largely contained within China, that could mean a dramatic impact on the companies that rely on Chinese labor for manufacturing. Apple is one such company, with Foxconn facilities in China responsible for producing millions of Apple smartphones. Now, with China locking down cities and extending downtime for the lunar holiday, the fight against the virus is reportedly making Apple feel the pinch. As Reuters reports , Foxconn is bracing for serious downtime and disruption in its production capabilities, with the decision to extend the widespread shutdown of its operations in China until at least February 10th. Even then, there's no guarantee that work at Foxconn's manufacturing facilities will resume, as officials continue to monitor the spread of the virus.\",\n",
